## Sentiment Analysis Machine Learning App

The sentiment analysis project leverages advanced data processing methodologies to clean and prepare text data for effective analysis. Using TF-IDF vectorisation, the text is transformed into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. The core of the project involves training a Naive Bayes classifier, which efficiently categorises input text into positive or negative sentiments. The project incorporates user-friendly technologies such as Streamlit for the interface and SQLite for data management, ensuring seamless interaction and storage. Users can input text, which is processed to generate sentiment predictions that are visually presented for easy interpretation. Along the development process, various challenges were encountered, including data handling and implementation complexities, which were systematically resolved to ensure the smooth functioning of the system.
